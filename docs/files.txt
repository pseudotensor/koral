Here is the KORAL code. I hope you find it useful and keep confident
for a moment.

It has not been optimized for a while, so you will find for sure a
number of "imperfect" pieces of code. However, I have recently cleaned
it up, added a number of comments and I hope it is readable.

It consists of a number of source files in the main folder which
contain problem-independent routines and subfolders (PROBLEMS/XXX)
containing problem-dependent files. They are #included into the main
source files, so whenever you modify any of the problem-specific
files, you need to run something like: "make clean; make" and then
"./ko" which is the executable.

Below is a nut-shell description of all the important files. Inside
them you will find a number of comments. I hope they are easy to read.

* main folder *
problem.h - choice of the problem
ko.c - high level calls, nothing interesting
finite.c - finite differencing, reconstruction, Lax-Friedrichs, grid etc.
physics.c - wave speed calculation, formulae for fluxes, source terms
problem.c - calls for problem-related routines
rad.c - radiation-related routines
relele.c - some relativistic stuff
frames.c - frame boosts etc.
metric.c - metric components
misc.c - mainly memory allocations
fileop.c - file operations (the code writes ascii dump files plus
calls gnuplot to produce gifs on the go)
u2p.c - conserved to primitives converter
p2u.c - primitives to conserved converter
zsolve_quartic.c - solver for quartic equations
ko.h - definitions, nothing interesting

* problem folder *
init.c - initial state
bc.c - boundary conditions
dump.c - calculation of non-standard output
kappa.c - absorption opacities
kappaes.c - scattering opacities
out2gif_1d.c - gnuplot macro in 1d
out2gif_2d.c - gnuplot macro in 2d
anasol.c - unused
