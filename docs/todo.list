0208 - ** - correct u2p_cold to generalize to relative velocities
0208 - **** - that tetrad issue, multiplying conserved by alpha?
0206 - ** - simplify transformations of radiative primitives between coordinates - Erf intact, urf through trans2_coco()
0205 - * - follow the radiative wavespeeds to set the timestep properly
