0319 - *** - explicit criterion
0319 - ****** - why primitives changed during the advective operator
0318 - **** - dumped lab implicit to allow for longer timesteps, see below
0318 - **** - follow the radiative wavespeeds to set the timestep properly
0314 - **** - correct LABFLUXES by providing geom to u2p_rad_urf
0313 - *** - implement Eddington approximation
0313 - ** - in topcap include a limiter for switching between GAMMAMAX for tau<<1 and fluid frame for tau>>1
0312 - ** - metric tetrad order does not correspond to eup,elo - cross check
0310 - ***** - geometry struct
0307 - **** - coco vs LABRADFLUX
0303 - *** - clean up after EDD
0303 - ** - radiative wave speed limiter as separated routine
0227 - ** - correct explicit sub-stepping
0226 - ****** - average over neighbors for unsuccesfull inversions etc
0208 - ** - correct u2p_cold to generalize to relative velocities
