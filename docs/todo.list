0521 - ***** - WAVESPEEDSATFACES for radiation
0307 - **** - coco vs LABRADFLUX
0404 - *** - calculate wavespeeds independently for each fluid
0320 - ** - generalize atmospheres for non-BL like coords
0319 - *** - explicit criterion
0319 - ****** - why primitives changed during the advective operator
0318 - **** - damped lab implicit to allow for longer timesteps, see below
0318 - **** - follow the radiative wavespeeds to set the timestep properly
0312 - ** - metric tetrad order does not correspond to eup,elo - cross check
0303 - ** - radiative wave speed limiter as separated routine
0227 - ** - correct explicit sub-stepping
